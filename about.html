      The country involed in the D-day attack were the American, British, and canadian soldiers.<br>
      The D-day attck was one of the largest amphibious assault that happened on June 6, 1944  so there is a lot talk about that <br>
      happened in the assault. The thing that gonna focus on that happen in the assault is the paratrooper <br>
      attack that happened before the land invasion. They planned the paratrooper attack to help weaken the <br>
      the front beaches to give the land assault a better chance of winning. The airborne divisions that were involved <br>
      in paratrooper assault were 101st, 82nd, and several of the british 6th airbourne division. The division had different <br>
      task they had to accomplish the 101st division had to capture the western UTAH.The 82nd task was to destroy the bridges <br>
      and halt a advanced from the west. Another task they had was take over the town of St. Mere Egles and to secure key <br>
      approaches to the allie backheads.
